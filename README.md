What it is
----------

A toy library featuring 2d shapes and matrix conversion on them. Should be pretty easy to grasp. If you can use it for anything, go ahead!

How to build
------------

Currently, 

    mvn package

builds a scala library, while

    sbt compile

builds scalaJS. This is an ugly hack of course, and I should really set up cross build in sbt,
but for now does what I need.
